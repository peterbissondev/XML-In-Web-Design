# XML-In-Web-Design
Objective: World Spoken Languages and Code Translation First.

Preview: Applying XML could be XHTML, at the client, is about recognizing that everything within a web page can be interpreted, and possibly even the XML and code, for multiple language use. The result is fragments of code page types, undergoing constant re-evolution for best performance.

When developing a website, content presentation and design account for a lot for the ideas presented but site developing is also about markets, which today are open to absolutely everything that is presented on a virtual web page or application.

In short, I've done it all, left, right, top, and bottom, slide in, open, close, drop-in, very wide, very long, over-sized, and yet historically, the newest text scrolls would be long web pages.

Thinking a little further, clay tablets are like a single page, left and right, like the parchment scrolls of Egypt and Isreal, up and down, the paper scrolls read by the kings of England. (Not 100% historical fact, other than the idea to present text, historically was mostly a matter of side-to-side documents whereas text application preferences, based on technology, are an up and down document scrolling adaptation.)

So, scrolling and why it matters, seemingly insignificant, has a history in fact finding and is only one part of the page text. Suggesting again, everything within web page, in markets, is researchable but that is why I'm working with the objective of XML at the client, and the idea of deprecating HTML.

And the focus while on scrolling at the moment or XML, well, computers don't care what the numbers are, only that they are consistent with the application, and then we might imagine, even if the focus changes to XML, how powerful the XML might be if it is translated into multiple languages, as in Sumerian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Chinese, Brahmi, and English.

Of course, there are so many more written languages, but I'm working on the diversity of languages because the XML should work. Not so sure about how HTML interpretation would work out. 

Working With UTF-8

 When asking a tool like Copilot to do some translation, what pops up, are the characters, at times very symbolic compared to English text, yet the text is also written directly at a document. just as writing English.

Once again, a point in fact finding. It makes sense when a keyboard is transformed for language use, the references to the character type, but without the keyboard transformed, Copilot will go and get the accurate characters, and they become visible just as any other text!

If you are not use to this, as I am not, the experience was nothing less than shocking!

What the experience has suggested to me, is that in translation of code and content, I also have to do some research about the meaning of the word(s) applied because in any language, nonsense is nonsense and would not be the intention of translating the XML code or text.

UTF-8 is going to have to be studied with Copilot and I'm also going to follow up with Google Fonts for many languages, color maps can be picked from a favorite image, as the color choices within an image are coordinated for the eyes.

About My Hobby or Work

I've been a client-side developer since 1997, just as iframes were first introduced, but now, I'm placing emphasis on integrating World and fact finding within my code and content.
