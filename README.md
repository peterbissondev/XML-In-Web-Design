# XML-In-Web-Design
Objective: XML Application in Multi-Language Code and Text Client-Side Editor.

Developing a client-side application in XML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on xhtml namespace where required, so that the main Web page acts as it would with HTML features yet without predefined elements or tag properties.

Also, with Multi-Language Code and Text, to take into consideration, that markets are increasingly applying all context of content is researchable. So as people write or edit in muliti-language, could consider a drop down box following the text for imediate several language writing selection. Could help in word learning.

There is more idea and theory, at the momoent, in looking at World, could be response, given a language, should we expect the world to adapt to up and down verses side to side scrolling?

The selected languages is about their visual implementation because in design. does the context of design change depending on the language?

The study of translation for tag and text meaning, both have to be re-evaluated again and again, to integrate better translation in code and text. For example, we could apply "p" or "paragraph" in the English language to define an XML tag, but what do they mean even if translated to another language? These are language semantics which have to be studied to make the application work.

My finding to date includes code fragmentation is high for a simplified application but looking at increased security features, as well.

We may be in the times where moving forward to real world and true technology fact finding development. No more, suggestive thinking verses actions.
